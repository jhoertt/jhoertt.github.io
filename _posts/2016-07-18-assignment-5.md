# Assignment 5

Our script for assigment 5 first asks the user for their mySql database password. Our script then creates the database, the table in the database, and define its rows. Then our script puts all the answers into a single file and puts the data into a tableNext our script puts the database into a .sql file. At the end of our script, the temporary csv file where the information was stored is no longer needed, so it is removed.
