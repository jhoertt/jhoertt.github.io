  Hello! While the main purpose of this website is to provide more information about INLS 161, below is a little bit about me.

## About Me

My name is Jake Hoertt and I will be a junior here at UNC Chapel Hill in the fall. I am studying Mathematical Decision Sciences and minoring in information systems at SILS. I am from Huntersville, North Carolina, but was born in Columbus, Ohio. I like to follow the NBA, run, and read. I also have three younger brothers, a step-brother, and a step-sister.
