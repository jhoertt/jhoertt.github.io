# Assignment 3

## Converting Documents

For assignment 3 we used a scripted program to convert a markdown file into multiple output formats. In order to accomplish this we used Pandoc, Texlive, and Bash scripts. Once Pandoc and Texlive are installed, we were able to use the command pandoc -o filename.*insertdesiredformat* filename.md.
